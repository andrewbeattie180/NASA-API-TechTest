NASA Image Search TECHTEST

Brief: Create an app using the NASA Image and Audio API.


Aims:

1- Using React/Material UI, create a front end that has a search facility, with options to select Images/Audio.
    - Lift the state up to the main app component from the input and the toggle switches. (DONE)
2- Using Express/Node, create the back end functionality to parse the JSON that is returned by the NASA API, and then
    render 8 images on the front end using a map.
3- Ensure there is functionality for all HTTPS codes that can be returned by the API (within reason) (optional but ideal)
4- When an image is clicked on, the full image is shown along with a description (this can be taken from the API)
